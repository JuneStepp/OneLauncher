In order to connect via SSL/TLS, the server's certificate is validated against
the certificate chain stored in this file. When Turbine updates their
certificate chain, this program will break (again) with the error message:

	[E15] SSL Error occured in HTTPS connection

In that case you will need re-assemble the certificate chain and place it into
this file. Useful commands at the time of this writing include:

	openssl s_client -connect gls.lotro.com:443

...which will attempt to connect to the LotRO authentication server and
allow you to copy+paste the server's certificate and begin hunting down the
chain. In order to read each certificate as you work your way up the chain,
you can use:

	openssl x509 -in <path/to/pem/certificate> -text

...in order to dump information about the specified certificate. You may
need to add '-inform der' if the certificate is in binary format. Look
for the 'Authority Information Access' under 'X509v3 extensions' in order
to quickly retrieve URLs for the certificate chain. You may also need to
retrieve the root certificate from your local '/etc/ssl/certs/'.

When you have retrieved all of the certificates, you will need to concatenate
them together. In order to verify that this has been done correctly, again use
the 'openssl verify' command, and in addition use the '-CAfile <pemfile>'
argument. It's best to start with the root authority and then work your way
down (in the order opposite of which the certificates were retrieved). Note
that, when I did this, the root authority wasn't required for the command
to verify, but was necessary for the program to actually work.

Good luck.
