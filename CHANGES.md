# Changes

1.2 (Unreleased)

        *  Addon manager
             Manage, update, and browse/download
                 *  plugins (with dependency checking)
                 *  themes (DDO support too!)
                 *  music (.abc files/collections off files)
        * Self updater
        * Multiple accounts support
        * Custom directory selection in setup wizard
        * Many more smaller improvements

1.1

    This is a big release that adds a lot of polish and usability to OneLauncher. With the built in prefix it is now possible to always run LOTRO and DDO in the best way possible without any knowledge of Wine. Even an install on a separate windows partition should work!

      *  Redone setup wizard
      *  Auto setup OneLauncher Wine prefix (In game stores should work)
            *  Built in dxvk support (Lets directx11 get used with lotro and ddo)
            *  Built in esync support
            *  Built in wine downloading (Seperate wine should still be installed for dependencies)
      *  Option to securely remember account password
      *  Window dragging
      *  Redone language selection
      *  Many more smaller improvements

1.0

    My first release with many updates for the modern day and design improvements. I'm having a lot of fun with this, so I hope you enjoy it too!
      * Redone ui
      * 64-bit client support
      * Update to PyQt5
      * New pyinstaller based building system to one executable
      * Rebrand to OneLauncher
      * Many more smaller improvements

<hr>Below this is PyLotRO. Above is when it became OneLauncher<hr/>

0.2.6

    Updated certificate chain to new SSL certificates after recent update (22.0.1 or possibly 22) update
        by SSG broke authentication using the old certs.

0.2.5

    Added code to check for local game client override in TurbineLauncher.exe.config in game
        directory.  This is to handle workaround from SSG for game client crashes on
        Windows XP/Vista platforms that also affects Linux users running the game under
        wine.  For more information see link below.

0.2.4

    News feed fixed - Apparently Turbine changed the content encoding of the news feed to
        gzip and retrieving the news feed was failing.  We now accept gzip content
        encoding for the news feed by default and check the Content-Encoding header and
        uncompress if content is gzip.
        Also some palette adjustments to the widgets (darker theme)

0.2.3

    Localization changes from hcjiv1 and Arek75. Turbine has removed the client local
        files for each language. Now each language has a separate subdirectory. If
        the client local file is not found then I (hcjiv1) pick languages based on those
        subdirectories.  Thanks to hcjiv1 and Arek75.  Version bump to 0.2.3

0.2.2

    Fixes for Update 15.1 changes to launcher.config argument template.  Turbine is now
        using crashserverurl and DefaultUploadThrottleMbps in the argument template.
        Version bump to 0.2.2.

0.2.1

    Fixes for launcher.config XML Changes and version bump to 0.2.1

        broke pylotro.

            Windows version now smaller in size (due to allowing py2exe to
            put all pyc files in zip file)
            Due to issues with child windows drawing under the parent
            window on some systems, add option under tools so that all
            child windows hide the parent and then redisplay the parent
