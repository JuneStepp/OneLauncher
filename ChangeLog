0.1.13  LotRO is now F2P, remove account check

0.1.14  Get proper CSS file for newsfeed
        New error [E14] if game account not linked to user account

0.1.15  Fix problem getting newsfeed (might be temp glitch)
		Fix EN GB -> English problem

0.2.0	Fix newsfeed (again) after site revamp
		Fix XML parsing	that relied on consistent behaviour of undefined ordering
		Fix problems when path settings have trailing (back-)slashes.
		Support for Python 3.x, PyQt 4.6+ and OpenSSL 1.x
		Enable server authentication for better security (Python 3.2+ only currently)

0.2.1	Fixes for launcher.config XML Changes and version bump to 0.2.1
		Fix for 20-Nov-2014 slight changes to WorldQueue.config by Turbine which
		broke pylotro.

0.2.2	Fixes for Update 15.1 changes to launcher.config argument template.  Turbine is now
		using crashserverurl and DefaultUploadThrottleMbps in the argument template.
		Version bump to 0.2.2.

0.2.3	Localization changes from hcjiv1 and Arek75. Turbine has removed the client local
		files for each language. Now each language has a separate subdirectory. If
		the client local file is not found then I (hcjiv1) pick languages based on those
		subdirectories.  Thanks to hcjiv1 and Arek75.  Version bump to 0.2.3

0.2.4	News feed fixed - Apparently Turbine changed the content encoding of the news feed to
		gzip and retrieving the news feed was failing.  We now accept gzip content
		encoding for the news feed by default and check the Content-Encoding header and
		uncompress if content is gzip.
		Also some palette adjustments to the widgets (darker theme)

0.2.5	Added code to check for local game client override in TurbineLauncher.exe.config in game
		directory.  This is to handle workaround from SSG for game client crashes on
		Windows XP/Vista platforms that also affects Linux users running the game under
		wine.  For more information see link below.

0.2.6	Updated certificate chain to new SSL certificates after recent update (22.0.1 or possibly 22) update
		by SSG broke authentication using the old certs.

1.0.0 Renamed to OneLauncher, updated, improved, and redid ui. (Basically a lot of stuff)

  -- Window dragging
  -- Option to securely remember account password
  -- Redone language selection
